# Gren tools for NodeJS

This repository contains two packages, each in it's own sub-folder:

* `bin`: An npm package which let's you install the Gren compiler on your system.
* `lib`: A nodejs package which let's you install the Gren compiler, and compile Gren programs from JavaScript applications.
